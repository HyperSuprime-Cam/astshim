    /**
    Obtain a quadratic approximation to a 2D Mapping.

    Compute the coefficients of a quadratic fit to the
    supplied Mapping over the input area specified by `lbnd` and `ubnd`.
    The Mapping must have 2 inputs, but may have any number of outputs.
    The i'th Mapping output is modeled as a quadratic function of the
    2 inputs (x,y):

    output_i = a_i_0 + a_i_1*x + a_i_2*y + a_i_3*x*y + a_i_4*x*x +
               a_i_5*y*y

    The `fit` vector is set tothe values of the co-efficients a_0_0, a_0_1, etc.

    @param[in] map  Mapping to fit.
    @param[in] lbnd  The lower bounds of a box defined within the input
       coordinate system of the Mapping. The number of elements in this
       vector should equal map.getNin(). This
       box should specify the region over which the fit is to be
       performed.
    @param[in] ubnd  The upper bounds of the box specifying the region over
       which the fit is to be performed.
    @param[in] nx  The number of points to place along the first Mapping input. The
       first point is at
       `lbnd[0]` and the last is at `ubnd[0]"`.
       If a value less than three is supplied a value of three will be used.
    @param[in] ny   The number of points to place along the second Mapping input. The
       first point is at `lbnd[1]` and the last is at `ubnd[1]`.
       If a value less than three is supplied a value of three will be used.

    @throw std::invalid_argument if the mapping does not have 2 inputs,
        or if lbnd or ubnd do not each contain 2 elements.
    @throw std::runtime_error if the fit cannot be computed.
