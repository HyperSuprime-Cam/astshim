/**
 * Construct a FrameSet that performs two transformations in series.
 *
 * When used as a Mapping, the FrameSet shall apply `first`, followed by
 * `second`. Its inverse shall apply the inverse of `second`, followed by the
 * inverse of `first`. The concatenation is only valid if `first.getCurrent()`
 * and `second.getBase()` have the same number of axes.
 *
 * The new FrameSet shall contain all Frames and Mappings from `first`,
 * followed by all Frames and Mappings from `second`, preserving their
 * original order. The current frame of `first` shall be connected to the base
 * frame of `second` by a UnitMap. The new set's base frame shall be the base
 * frame of `first`, and its current frame shall be the current frame of `second`.
 *
 * The FrameSet shall be independent of the input arguments, so changes to the
 * original FrameSets (in particular, reassignments of their base or current
 * frames) shall not affect it.
 *
 * @param first, second the FrameSets to concatenate.
 * @return a pointer to a combined FrameSet as described above
 *
 * Example: if `first` has 3 frames and `second `has 4, then the result shall
 *          contain 7 frames, of which frames 1-3 are the same as frames 1-3 of
 *          `first`, in order, and frames 4-7 are the same as frames
 *          1-4 of `second`, in order.
