/**
Call astPolyTran to set (or replace) one direction of a polynomial transform
with a fit based on the other direction.

@tparam AstMapT  AST mapping class: one of AstChebyMap or AstPolyMap
@tparam MapT  Corresponding astshim class: one of ast::ChebyMap or ast::PolyMap;
    this template parameter is second because it can always be deduced.

@param[in] mapping
@param[in] forward  If true the forward transformation is replaced.
                Otherwise the inverse transformation is replaced.
@param[in] acc  The target accuracy, expressed as a geodesic distance within
                the ChebyMap's input space (if `forward` is true)
                or output space (if `forward` is false).
@param[in] maxacc  The maximum allowed accuracy for an acceptable polynomial,
                expressed as a geodesic distance within the ChebyMap's input space
                (if `forward` is true) or output space (if `forward` is false).
@param[in] maxorder  The maximum allowed polynomial order. This is one more than the
                maximum power of either input axis. So for instance, a value of
                3 refers to a quadratic polynomial.
                Note, cross terms with total powers greater than or equal to `maxorder`
                are not inlcuded in the fit. So the maximum number of terms in
                each of the fitted polynomials is `maxorder*(maxorder + 1)/2.`
@param[in] lbnd  A vector holding the lower bounds of a rectangular region within
                the ChebyMap's input space (if `forward` is true)
                or output space (if `forward` is false).
                The new polynomial will be evaluated over this rectangle. The length
                should equal getNin() or getNout(), depending on `forward`.
@param[in] ubnd  A vector holding the upper bounds of a rectangular region within
                the ChebyMap's input space (if `forward` is true)
                or output space (if `forward` is false).
                The new polynomial will be evaluated over this rectangle. The length
                should equal getNin() or getNout(), depending on `forward`.

@throw std::invalid_argument if the size of `lbnd` or `ubnd` does not match getNin() (if `forward` true)
                or getNout() (if `forward` false).
