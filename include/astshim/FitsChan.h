/**
A specialized form of \ref Channel which reads and writes FITS header cards

Writing an @ref Object to a @ref FitsChan will, if the @ref Object is suitable, generate a
description of that @ref Object composed of FITS header cards, and
reading from a @ref FitsChan will create a new @ref Object from its FITS
header card description.

While a @ref FitsChan is active, it represents a buffer which may
contain zero or more 80-character "header cards" conforming to
FITS conventions. Any sequence of FITS-conforming header cards
may be stored, apart from the "END" card whose existence is
merely implied.  The cards may be accessed in any order by using
the @ref FitsChan's @ref FitsChan_Card "Card" attribute, which identifies a "current"
card, to which subsequent operations apply. Searches
based on keyword may be performed (using @ref findFits), new
cards may be inserted (@ref putFits, @ref putCards, @ref setFitsS and similar)
and existing ones may be deleted with @ref delFits, extracted with @ref getFitsS and similar,
or changed with @ref setFitsS and similar.

### Missing Methods

Tables are not yet supported, so the following AST functions are not wrapped as methods:
- astGetTables
- astPutTable
- astPutTables
- astRemoveTables
- astTableSource

### Attributes

@ref FitsChan has the following attributes, in addition to those
provided by @ref Channel and @ref Object

- @ref FitsChan_AllWarnings "AllWarnings": A list of the available conditions
- @ref FitsChan_Card "Card": Index of current FITS card in a FitsChan
- @ref FitsChan_CardComm "CardComm": The comment of the current FITS card in a FitsChan
- @ref FitsChan_CardName "CardName": The keyword name of the current FITS card in a FitsChan
- @ref FitsChan_CardType "CardType": The data type of the current FITS card in a FitsChan
- @ref FitsChan_CarLin "CarLin": Ignore spherical rotations on CAR projections?
- @ref FitsChan_CDMatrix "CDMatrix": Use a CD matrix instead of a PC matrix?
- @ref FitsChan_Clean "Clean": Remove cards used whilst reading even if an error occurs?
- @ref FitsChan_DefB1950 "DefB1950": Use FK4 B1950 as default equatorial coordinates?
- @ref FitsChan_Encoding "Encoding": System for encoding Objects as FITS headers
- @ref FitsChan_FitsAxisOrder "FitsAxisOrder": Sets the order of WCS axes within new FITS-WCS headers
- @ref FitsChan_FitsDigits "FitsDigits": Digits of precision for floating-point FITS values
- @ref FitsChan_Iwc "Iwc": Add a Frame describing Intermediate World Coords?
- @ref FitsChan_NCard "NCard": Number of FITS header cards in a FitsChan
- @ref FitsChan_Nkey "Nkey": Number of unique keywords in a FitsChan
- @ref FitsChan_TabOK "TabOK": Should the FITS "-TAB" algorithm be recognised?
- @ref FitsChan_PolyTan "PolyTan": Use PVi_m keywords to define distorted TAN projection?
- @ref FitsChan_Warnings "Warnings": Produces warnings about selected conditions

### Notes

- Call @ref setFitsU to store a keyword that has no associated value (i.e. a card with unknown value).
- Call @ref setFitsCM to store a pure comment card (i.e. a card with a blank keyword).
- To assign a new value for an existing keyword, first find the card describing the keyword
    using \ref findFits, and then use the appropriate `setFits` function (e.g. @ref setFitsS)
    to overwrite the old value.

As for any Channel, when you create a @ref FitsChan, you specify a
@ref Stream which sources and sinks data
by reading and writing FITS header cards. If you provide
a source, it is used to fill the @ref FitsChan with header cards
when it is accessed for the first time. If you do not provide a
source, the @ref FitsChan remains empty until you explicitly enter
data into it (e.g. using `putFits`, `putCards`, @ref write
or by using the SourceFile attribute to specifying a text file from
which headers should be read). When the @ref FitsChan is deleted, any
remaining header cards in the @ref FitsChan will be written to the sink.

Coordinate system information may be described using FITS header
cards using several different conventions, termed
"encodings". When an AST @ref Object is written to (or read from) a
@ref FitsChan, the value of the @ref FitsChan's Encoding attribute
determines how the @ref Object is converted to (or from) a
description involving FITS header cards. In general, different
encodings will result in different sets of header cards to
describe the same @ref Object. Examples of encodings include the DSS
encoding (based on conventions used by the STScI Digitised Sky
Survey data), the FITS-WCS encoding (based on a proposed FITS
standard) and the NATIVE encoding (a near loss-less way of
storing AST Objects in FITS headers).

The available encodings differ in the range of Objects they can
represent, in the number of @ref Object descriptions that can coexist
in the same @ref FitsChan, and in their accessibility to other
(external) astronomy applications (see the Encoding attribute
for details). Encodings are not necessarily mutually exclusive
and it may sometimes be possible to describe the same @ref Object in
several ways within a particular set of FITS header cards by
using several different encodings.

The detailed behaviour of @ref read and @ref write, when used with
a @ref FitsChan, depends on the encoding in use. In general, however,
all successful use of @ref read is destructive, so that FITS header cards
are consumed in the process of reading an @ref Object, and are
removed from the @ref FitsChan (this deletion can be prevented for
specific cards by calling the @ref retainFits function).
An unsuccessful call of @ref read
(for instance, caused by the @ref FitsChan not containing the necessary
FITS headers cards needed to create an @ref Object) results in the
contents of the @ref FitsChan being left unchanged.

If the encoding in use allows only a single @ref Object description
to be stored in a @ref FitsChan (e.g. the `DSS`, `FITS-WCS` and `FITS-IRAF`
encodings), then write operations using @ref write will
over-write any existing @ref Object description using that
encoding. Otherwise (e.g. the `NATIVE` encoding), multiple @ref Object
descriptions are written sequentially and may later be read
back in the same sequence.

    /**
    Search for a card in a @ref FitsChan by keyword.

    The search commences at the current card (identified by the `Card`
    attribute) and ends when a card is found whose FITS keyword
    matches the template supplied, or when the last card in the
    @ref FitsChan has been searched.

    @warning this is very different than the `getFitsX` methods such as @ref getFitsS,
    whose search wraps around. In order to search all keys using @ref findFits you must
    first call @ref clearCard.

    If the search is successful (i.e. a card is found which matches the template),
    the contents of the card are returned and the @ref FitsChan_Card "Card" attribute is adjusted
    to identify the card found (if `inc` false) or the one following it (if `inc` is true).

    If the search is not successful, the @ref FitsChan_Card "Card" attribute is set to the "end-of-file".

    @param[in] name  The keyword to be found. In the simplest case,
                    this should simply be the keyword name (the search is case
                    insensitive and trailing spaces are ignored). However, this
                    template may also contain "field specifiers" which are
                    capable of matching a range of characters (see the "Keyword
                    Templates" section for details). In this case, the first card
                    with a keyword which matches the template will be found. To
                    find the next FITS card regardless of its keyword, you should
                    use the template "%f".
    @param[in] inc  If `false` (and the search is successful), the
                    @ref FitsChan's @ref FitsChan_Card "Card" attribute will be set to the index of the card
                    that was found. If `true`, however, the `Card`
                    attribute will be incremented to identify the card which
                    follows the one found.

    @return data as a FoundValue

    ### Keyword Templates

    The templates used to match FITS keywords are normally composed
    of literal characters, which must match the keyword exactly
    (apart from case). However, a template may also contain "field
    specifiers" which can match a range of possible characters. This
    allows you to search for keywords that contain (for example)
    numbers, where the digits comprising the number are not known in
    advance.

    A field specifier starts with a "%" character. This is followed
    by an optional single digit (0 to 9) specifying a field
    width. Finally, there is a single character which specifies the

    type of character to be matched, as follows:

    - "c": matches all upper case letters,
    - "d": matches all decimal digits,
    - "f": matches all characters which are permitted within a FITS
        keyword (upper case letters, digits, underscores and hyphens).

    If the field width is omitted, the field specifier matches one
    or more characters. If the field width is zero, it matches zero
    or more characters. Otherwise, it matches exactly the number of
    characters specified. In addition to this:

    - The template "%f" will match a blank FITS keyword consisting
        of 8 spaces (as well as matching all other keywords).
    - A template consisting of 8 spaces will match a blank keyword (only).

    For example:

    - The template "BitPix" will match the keyword "BITPIX" only.
    - The template "crpix%1d" will match keywords consisting of "CRPIX" followed by one decimal digit.
    - The template "P%c" will match any keyword starting with "P" and followed by one or more letters.
    - The template "E%0f" will match any keyword beginning with "E".
    - The template "%f" will match any keyword at all (including a blank one).

    ### Examples

    `auto foundvalue = fitschan.findFits("%f", true)`

        Return the current FITS card and advance the @ref FitsChan_Card "Card" attribute
        to the card that follows (the "%f" template matches any keyword).

    `auto foundvalue = fitschan.findFits("BITPIX", false)

        Return the next FITS card with the "BITPIX" keyword
        and leave the @ref FitsChan_Card "Card" attribute pointing to it.
        You might wish to then call `setFitsI(...)` to modify its value.

    `auto foundvalue = fitscan.findFits("COMMENT", true)`

        Return the next COMMENT card and advance the @ref FitsChan_Card "Card" attribute
        to the card that follows.

    `auto foundvalue = fitschan.findFits("CRVAL%1d", true)`

        Return the next keyword of the form "CRVALi" (for example,
        any of the keywords "CRVAL1", "CRVAL2" or "CRVAL3" would be matched).
        Advance the @ref FitsChan_Card "Card" attribute to the card that follows.
