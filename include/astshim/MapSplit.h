A Mapping split off as a subset of another Mapping.

Fields:
- splitMap:  Shared pointer to the split mapping.
- origIn:  Indices of the inputs of the original mapping were picked for the split mapping
        (a copy of the `in` argument of the constructor).
- origOut:  Indices of the outputs of the original mapping which are fed by the picked inputs.
        This will contain splitMap->getNout() elements, each in the range [1, nout of the original mapping].
        The `i`th element holds the index within the original mapping which corresponds to
        the `i`th output of the split mapping. For example if the 1st output of the split mapping
        came from the 5th output of the original mapping, then origOut[0] = 5 (0 because
        vectors use 0-based indexing, and 5 because AST index values are 1-based).

    Construct a MapSplit

    The subset is specified by choosing a subset of inputs from
    an existing Mapping. Such a split is only possible if the specified inputs
    correspond to some subset of the original Mapping's outputs. That is, there
    must exist a subset of the Mapping outputs for which each output
    depends only on the selected Mapping inputs, and not on any of the
    inputs which have not been selected. Also, any output which is not in
    this subset must not depend on any of the selected inputs.

    @param[in] map  Mapping to split.
    @param[in] in  Indices of inputs of `map` to pick.
        Each element should have a value in the range [1, map.getNin()].

    @throw std::runtime_error if `map` cannot be split as specified.
