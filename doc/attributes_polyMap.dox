@section PolyMap_Attributes PolyMap Attributes

@subsection PolyMap_IterInverse IterInverse

Provide an iterative inverse transformation? (bool)

This attribute indicates whether the inverse transformation of
the PolyMap should be implemented via an iterative Newton-Raphson
approximation that uses the forward transformation to transform
candidate input positions until an output position is found which
is close to the required output position. By default, an iterative
inverse is provided if, and only if, no inverse polynomial was supplied
when the PolyMap was constructed.

The @ref PolyMap_NiterInverse "NiterInverse" and @ref PolyMap_TolInverse "TolInverse"
attributes provide parameters that control the behaviour of the inverse approcimation method.


@subsection PolyMap_NiterInverse NiterInverse

Maximum number of iterations for the iterative inverse transformation. (int)

This attribute controls the iterative inverse transformation
used if the @ref PolyMap_IterInverse "IterInverse" attribute is non-zero.

Its value gives the maximum number of iterations of the
Newton-Raphson algorithm to be used for each transformed position.
The default value is 4. See also attribute @ref PolyMap_TolInverse "TolInverse".


@subsection PolyMap_TolInverse TolInverse

Target relative error for the iterative inverse transformation. (double)

This attribute controls the iterative inverse transformation
used if the @ref PolyMap_IterInverse "IterInverse" attribute is non-zero.

Its value gives the target relative error in teh axis values of
each transformed position. Further iterations will be performed
until the target relative error is reached, or the maximum number
of iterations given by attribute @ref PolyMap_NiterInverse "NiterInverse" is reached.

The default value is 1.0E-6.
