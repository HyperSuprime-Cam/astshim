@section FrameSet_Attributes FrameSet Attributes

@subsection FrameSet_AllVariants AllVariants

A list of the variant @ref Mapping "Mappings" associated with the current @ref Frame. (string, read only)

This attribute gives a space separated list of the names of all the
variant @ref Mapping "Mappings" associated with the current @ref Frame (see attribute
@ref FrameSet_Variant "Variant"). If the current @ref Frame has no variant @ref Mapping "Mappings", then the
list will hold a single entry equal to the @ref Frame_Domain "Domain" name of the
current @ref Frame.


@subsection FrameSet_Base Base

Index of base @ref Frame, starting from 1. (int)

This attribute gives the index of the @ref Frame which is to be
regarded as the "base" @ref Frame within a @ref FrameSet. The default is
the first @ref Frame added to the @ref FrameSet when it is created (this
@ref Frame always has an index of 1).

When setting a new value for this attribute, a string may be
supplied instead of an integer index. In this case a search
is made within the @ref FrameSet for a @ref Frame that has its @ref Frame_Domain "Domain"
attribute value equal to the supplied string (the comparison is
case-insensitive). If found, the @ref Frame is made the base @ref Frame.
Otherwise an error is reported.

### Notes

- The @ref Mapping.inverted "Inverse" of a @ref FrameSet
has the values of its @ref FrameSet_Base "Base" and @ref FrameSet_Current "Current" attributes interchanged.


@subsection FrameSet_Current Current

Index of current @ref Frame, starting from 1. (int)

This attribute gives the index of the @ref Frame which is to be
regarded as the "current" @ref Frame within a @ref FrameSet. The default
is the most recent @ref Frame added to the @ref FrameSet (this @ref Frame
always has an index equal to the @ref FrameSet's NFrame attribute).

When setting a new value for this attribute, a string may be
supplied instead of an integer index. In this case a search
is made within the @ref FrameSet for a @ref Frame that has its @ref Frame_Domain "Domain"
attribute value equal to the supplied string (the comparison is
case-insensitive). If found, the @ref Frame is made the current @ref Frame.
Otherwise an error is reported.

### Notes
- The @ref Mapping.inverted "Inverse" of a @ref FrameSet
has the values of its @ref FrameSet_Base "Base" and @ref FrameSet_Current "Current" attributes interchanged.


@subsection FrameSet_NFrame NFrame

Number of @ref Frame "Frames" in a @ref FrameSet. (int, read only)

This attribute gives the number of @ref Frame "Frames" in a @ref FrameSet. This
value will change as @ref Frame "Frames" are added or removed, but will
always be at least one.


@subsection FrameSet_Variant Variant

Indicates which variant of the current @ref Frame is to be used. (string)

This attribute can be used to change the @ref Mapping that connects the
current @ref Frame to the other @ref Frame "Frames" in the @ref FrameSet. By default, each
@ref Frame in a @ref FrameSet is connected to the other @ref Frame "Frames" by a single
@ref Mapping that can only be changed by using @ref FrameSet.remapFrame.
However, it is also possible to associate multiple @ref Mapping "Mappings"
with a @ref Frame, each @ref Mapping having an identifying name. If this is
done, the @ref FrameSet_Variant "Variant" attribute can be set to indicate the name of
the @ref Mapping that is to be used with the current @ref Frame.

A possible (if unlikely) use-case is to create a @ref FrameSet that can
be used to describe the WCS of an image formed by co-adding images
of two different parts of the sky. In such an image, each pixel contains
flux from two points on the sky.and so the WCS for the image should
ideally contain one pixel @ref Frame and two SkyFrames - one describing
each of the two co-added images. There is nothing to prevent a
@ref FrameSet containing two explicit SkyFrames, but the problem then arises
of how to distinguish between them. The two primary characteristics of
a @ref Frame that distinguishes it from other @ref Frame "Frames"Â are its class and its
@ref Frame_Domain "Domain" attribute value. The class of a @ref Frame cannot be changed, but we
could in principle use two different @ref Frame_Domain "Domain" values to distinguish the
two SkyFrames. However, in practice it is not uncommon for application
software to assume that SkyFrames will have the default @ref Frame_Domain "Domain" value
of "SKY". That is, instead of searching for @ref Frame "Frames" that have a class
of "SkyFrame", such software searches for @ref Frame "Frames" that have a @ref Frame_Domain "Domain"
of "SKY". To alleviate this problem, it is possible to add a single
SkyFrame to the @ref FrameSet, but specifying two alternate @ref Mapping "Mappings" to
use with the SkyFrame. Setting the @ref FrameSet_Variant "Variant" attribute to the name
of one or the other of these alternate @ref Mapping "Mappings" will cause the
SkyFrame to be remapped within the @ref FrameSet so that it uses the
specified @ref Mapping. The same facility can be used with any class of
@ref Frame, not just SkyFrames.

To use this facility, the @ref Frame should first be added to the
@ref FrameSet in the usual manner using @ref FrameSet.addFrame.
By default, the @ref Mapping supplied to @ref FrameSet.addFrame
is assigned a name equal to the @ref Frame_Domain "Domain" name of the @ref Frame.
To assign a different name to it, call @ref FrameSet.renameVariant.
The @ref FrameSet.addVariant method should then be called repeatedly
to add each required extra @ref Mapping to the current @ref Frame,
supplying a unique name for each one.

Each @ref Frame in a @ref FrameSet can have its own set of variant @ref Mapping "Mappings".
To control the @ref Mapping "Mappings" in use with a specific @ref Frame, you need first
to make it the current @ref Frame in the @ref FrameSet.

The @ref FrameSet.mirrorVariants function
allows the effects of variant @ref Mapping "Mappings" associated with a nominated
@ref Frame to be propagated to other @ref Frame "Frames" in the @ref FrameSet.

Once this has been done, setting a new value for the @ref FrameSet_Variant "Variant"
attribute of a @ref FrameSet will cause the current @ref Frame in the
@ref FrameSet to be remapped to use the specified variant @ref Mapping. An
error will be reported if the current @ref Frame has no variant @ref Mapping
with the supplied name.

Getting the value of the @ref FrameSet_Variant "Variant" attribute will return the name
of the variant @ref Mapping currently in use with the current @ref Frame. If
the @ref Frame has no variant @ref Mapping "Mappings", the value will default to the
@ref Frame_Domain "Domain" name of the current @ref Frame.

Clearing the @ref FrameSet_Variant "Variant" attribute will have the effect of removing
all variant @ref Mapping "Mappings" (except for the currently selected @ref Mapping) from
the current @ref Frame.

Testing the @ref FrameSet_Variant "Variant" attribute will return
a non-zero value if the current @ref Frame contains any variant @ref Mapping "Mappings",
and zero otherwise.

A complete list of the names associated with all the available
variant @ref Mapping "Mappings" in the current @ref Frame can be obtained from the
@ref FrameSet_AllVariants "AllVariants" attribute.

If a @ref Frame with variant @ref Mapping "Mappings" is remapped using
@ref FrameSet.remapFrame, the currently selected variant @ref Mapping is used by
@ref FrameSet.remapFrame
and the other variant @ref Mapping "Mappings" are removed from the @ref Frame.
