An experimental C++ shim around a subset of the Starlink AST astronomical library

The focus is on support for spatial mappings for use by LSST. Thus AST's functions that support
time, spectra and tables have not yet been wrapped.

See `docs/main.dox` for more information.
Better yet, build the documentation with `doxygen doc/doxygen.conf`
and see `docs/html/index.html`.
